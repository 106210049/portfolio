                <h2>What is physical design </h2>
                <p>
                    Physical design means --->> netlist (.v ) converted into GDSII form(layout form)
                    logical connectivity of cells converted into physical connectivity. <br>
                    During physical design, all design components are instantiated with their geometric representations.
                    In other words, all macros, cells, gates, transistors, etc., with fixed shapes and sizes per
                    fabrication layer, are assigned spatial locations (placement) and have appropriate routing
                    connections (routing) completed in metal layers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Physical design directly impacts circuit performance, area, reliability, power, and manufacturing
                    yield. Examples of these impacts are discussed below. <br>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Performance</b>: long routes have significantly longer signal delays.</li>
                    <li><b>Area</b>: placing connected modules far apart results in larger and slower chips.</li>
                    <li><b>Reliability</b>: A large number of vias can significantly reduce the reliability of the
                        circuit.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Power</b>: transistors with smaller gate lengths achieve greater switching speeds at the cost
                        of
                        higher
                        leakage current and manufacturing variability; larger transistors and longer wires result in
                        greater
                        dynamic power dissipation.</li>
                    <li><b>Yield</b>: wires routed too close together may decrease yield due to electrical shorts
                        occurring
                        during
                        manufacturing, but spreading gates too far apart may also undermine yield due to longer wires
                        and a
                        higher probability of opens</li>
                </ol>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to its high complexity, physical design is split into several key steps (Fig. 1). <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Partitioning</b>: breaks up a circuit into smaller sub-circuits or module which can each be
                        designed or
                        analyzed individually.</li>
                    <li><b>Floorplanning</b>: determines the shapes and arrangement of sub-circuits or modules, as well
                        as the
                        locations of external ports and IP or macro-blocks.</li>
                    <li><b>Power and ground routing (power planning)</b>: often intrinsic to floorplanning, distributes
                        power (VDD)
                        and ground (GND) nets throughout the chip.</li>
                    <li><b>Placement</b>: finds the spatial locations of all cells within each block.</li>
                    <li><b>Clock network synthesis</b>: determines the buffering, gating (e.g., for power management)
                        and routing
                        of the clock signal to meet prescribed skew and delay requirements.</li>
                    <li><b>Global routing</b>: allocates routing resources that are used for connections; example
                        resources include
                        routing tracks in the channel and in the switch box.</li>
                    <li><b>Detailed routing</b>: assigns routes to specific metal layers and routing tracks within the
                        global
                        routing resources.</li>
                    <li><b>Timing closure</b>: optimizes circuit performance by specialized placement or routing
                        techniques.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>**GDS- Graphical Data system</h4>
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The physical design is the process of transforming a circuit description into the physical
                        layout,
                        which describes the position of cells and routes for the interconnections between them.</li>
                    <li>The main concern is the physical design of VLSI-chips is to find a layout with minimal area,
                        further
                        the total wire length has to be minimized. For some critical nets there are hard limitations for
                        the
                        maximal wire length.</li>

                    The main steps in the ASIC PHYSICAL DESIGN flow are:
                <ol>
                    <li>Design netlist (after synthesis)
                    </li>
                    <li>Floorplanning </li>
                    <li>Power planning
                    </li>
                    <li>Placement</li>
                    <li>Clock Tree Synthesis(CTS)
                    </li>
                    <li>Routing</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>GDSII generation

                </ol>
                </p>
                <h4>Physical verification:</h4>
                <p>
                    After physical design is completed, the layout must be fully verified to ensure correct electrical
                    and logical functionality. Some problems found during physical verification can be tolerated if
                    their impact on chip yield is negligible. Therefore, at this stage, layout changes are usually
                    performed manually by experienced design engineers.
                </p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Design rule checking (DRC):</b> verifies that the layout meets all technology-imposed
                        constraints. DRC also verifies layer density for chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP).</li>
                    <li><b>Layout vs. schematic (LVS): </b>checking verifies the functionality of the design. From the
                        layout, a netlist is derived and compared with the original netlist produced from logic
                        synthesis or circuit design.</li>
                    <li><b>Parasitic extraction:</b>derives electrical parameters of the layout elements from their
                        geometric representations; with the netlist, these are used to verify the electrical
                        characteristics of the circuit.</li>
                    <li><b>Antenna rule checking:</b>seeks to prevent antenna effects, which may damage transistor gates
                        during manufacturing plasma-etch steps through the accumulation of excess charge on metal wires
                        that are not connected to PN junction node</li>
                    <li><b>Electrical rule checking (ERC):</b>verifies the correctness of power and ground connections,
                        and that signal transition times (slew), capacitive loads and fan-outs are appropriately bounded
                    </li>
                </ul>
